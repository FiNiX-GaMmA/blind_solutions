# **blind_solutions**
## coded by FiNyX-GaMmA

all the codes are wirtten in python

1. **Two sum:-**
  > I used a hashmap to map put the indices and i substracted the differnece of the current number from the target number. And i searched the differnece in the hashmap if present returned it
2. **Best time to buy and sell stocks:-**
  > I checked the values in the right to the values in the left if the left is bigger i sell that and move the left value to the current right place. Neverthe less i increment the right by 1
3. **Contains number:-**
  > for this i have put 3 different algorith and found that the one using the hashset is bettr that all others and the one using a hashmap or dictionary exceeds the time limit
4. **Array multiplication without itself**
  > **Method 1** - for this i took the array made a product of all the elements and i divided the current element from the product to get the multiplication without the current numbers.
  > **Method 2** - finding an optimal solution in process
